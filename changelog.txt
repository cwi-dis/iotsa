iotsa 1.5 - 26-Mar-2018

- WiFi config and general config have been split into two modules (listening on /wifi and /config, and the
  respective /api endpoints). All general configuration parameters are now in a global iotsaConfig structure.
  The iotsaConfig module does not have to be instantiated, this happens automatically.
- Configuration mode can now be active on the normal WiFi network. The special private network is only used when
  no WiFi network is configured or the configured network is not available. Private network no longer implies
  configuration mode.
- All web form argument handling has been converted to no longer using looping over the arguments.
- Default timeouts for reprogramming and configuration mode and such set to 5 minutes.
