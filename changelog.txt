iotsa 2.3 - in progress

- Added BLE support (esp32 only): iotsa devices can now be a Bluetooth LE server
- Added IotsaBatteryMod which enables power-saving for battery-operated devices.
- Fixed building of iotsa without WiFi support

iotsa 2.2 - 03-Dec-2019

- Updated to PlatformIO 4
- newer version of esp8266 and esp32 Arduino frameworks
- new ArduinoJson API
- Rationalized PlatformIO/Arduino support
- Backups and file listing implemented on esp32

iotsa 2.1 - 02-Jun-2019

- Got rid of default password, it provides no extra security.
- Allow uploading of certificate/key as DER with POST requests.
- Write-only REST attributes now always have a "has_" boolean in the read interface to signal that they exist and are set.
- REST read interface was made more consistent.

iotsa 2.0.1 - 01-Jul-2018

- Various changes to make https (server side) more usable, such as
  interfacing to the Igor Certificate Authority, and forwarding http
  requests to https. Added some scripts to help create certificates.
- Bug fixes for some security issues (which allowed config changes when not in config mode)

iotsa 2.0 - 31-May-2018

- The API has changed in an incompatible way: you no longer need to create the IotsaWebServer object
  yourself. The IotsaApplication constructor does this, if needed.
- The server by-reference instance variable of application and module objects is now a pointer.
- There are a number of compile-time flags in iotsaBuildOptions.h that enable and disable
  various features such as REST api access, normal web access and more.
- COAP is supported (as an alternative to, or in addition to, REST access).
- HTTPS is supported, as an alternative to HTTP.

iotsa 1.8.1 - 25-May-2018

- Fixed issue with platformio not finding ESP8266HttpClient.h

iotsa 1.8 - 15-Apr-2018

- IotsaRequest and IotsaButton modules added.

iotsa 1.7.2 - 8-Apr-2018

- Enabled (experimental) esp32 support again.
- Various fixes to iotsaControl and how it interfaces to iotsa boards

iotsa 1.7.1 - 30-Mar-2018

- Added iotsaControl module and program to allow programmatic configuration of iotsa devices.
- Added more variables to /api/config for iotsaControl.
- Fixed case error in Esp.h include which stopped travis builds from working.

iotsa 1.6.1

- Added iotsaVersion.h and return version info in config api.

iotsa 1.6 - 26-Mar-2018

- WiFi config and general config have been split into two modules (listening on /wifi and /config, and the
  respective /api endpoints). All general configuration parameters are now in a global iotsaConfig structure.
  The iotsaConfig module does not have to be instantiated, this happens automatically.
- Configuration mode can now be active on the normal WiFi network. The special private network is only used when
  no WiFi network is configured or the configured network is not available. Private network no longer implies
  configuration mode.
- All web form argument handling has been converted to no longer using looping over the arguments.
- Default timeouts for reprogramming and configuration mode and such set to 5 minutes.

iotsa 1.5 - 8-Mar-2018
