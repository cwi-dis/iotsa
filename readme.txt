Folder fritzing contains design (circuit and PCB, and partial breadboard layout)
for a PCB based on an ESP-12 that makes a nice iotsa hardware platform.

It has the ESP-12, a 3.3v regulator (so it can be powered with a standard 5v power
supply) and a free section with enough space for a DIP IC (up to DIP-20) and/or
a few discrete components. All easily usable GPIO pins are also available.
There's also room for an FTDI header and reset/program buttons.

The board is about 7x4cm in size.
